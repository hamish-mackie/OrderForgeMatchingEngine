// File to keep track of benchmarking results

// This result is the first run, I've used a release build and turned logging off, nothing has really been optimised.
// The results were very bad with logging turned on.
// We can also see that as we hold more data in our order book, the process time gets considerably worse.

// I noticed that the thing that was taking the time was removing (linear search, slow to remove from front vector), and iterating the vector.
// I've changed the data structure of the order book level to a vector<orderid, Order*> and got significant speed ups.
// Despite having to copy and allocate a new pointer on the heap, its much faster to iterate the vector of smaller objects,
// When the vector needs to reallocate, it also won't have to copy as much.
// This gives me an idea, Since we need to allocate each time anyway, We may as well use a map.

// Some numbers with logging turned on
Logging to std out, 500,000 orders took ~7 seconds
Logging to file, 500,000 orders took ~2 seconds (240,000 orders/second)

// These numbers are ok, But we can do better.
// If the formatting and logging could be offloaded to a back up thread we could get close to the speed without logging I think.

// Moved the logging to a separate thread! 2.3 million orders per second with logging turned on!
